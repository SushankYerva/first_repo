# ðŸª™ Wallet Recovery GUI (Tkinter)

A **Python-based Tkinter GUI** application designed for **seed phrase validation and wallet recovery**. It allows users to recover missing or partial wallet seed phrases by leveraging **BIP-39** and **BIP-44** standards. This application is specifically designed for cryptocurrency wallet recovery with support for **Mainnet** and **Testnet** addresses.

> **Legal & Ethical Use Only**: This tool should only be used for wallet recovery where you own the assets or have explicit permission to recover the wallet.

## Features

- **Seed Phrase Validation**: Checks the validity of seed phrases using **BIP-39**.
- **Wallet Recovery**: Recovers wallet addresses by generating candidate seed phrases.
- **Multi-address Support**: Supports both **P2PKH** and **Bech32** address types.
- **Progress Visualization**: Displays a progress bar with real-time updates while recovering wallet addresses.
- **Export Functionality**: Export recovered wallet addresses and secrets (e.g., **WIF**, **xpub**, **xprv**) as CSV files.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SushankYerva/wallet_recovery.git
   cd wallet-recovery-gui
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # On Windows:
   .venv\Scriptsctivate
   # On macOS/Linux:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the GUI:
   ```bash
   python -m src.gui
   ```

### Usage

1. **Seed Recovery**: Enter a partial or complete seed phrase and recover missing words.
2. **Wallet Recovery**: Enter the full seed phrase and recover wallet addresses.
3. **Exporting**: Export the recovered addresses and secrets into **CSV** files for secure storage.
